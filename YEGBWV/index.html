    <h2>What is a Backwater Valve? <br>Do you have a backwater valve?</h2>
    A backwater valve is a device that prevents sewer water from coming into your home.<br><br>
    When the city sewer is full, due to rain or heavy use, the sewer drain attached to your home may become full of communal sewer water, and without a backwater valve, may even back up into your home.<br><br>
    Homes built after 1989 are required to have a backwater valve, so if your home is newer than that, chances are very good you do have one. <br><br>
    If your home is older and you do not have one currently installed in your home you may be eligible for up to $800 in rebates if you make the decision to have one installed in your home!<br><br>
